# CTF Writeups

Welcome to my repository of **Capture the Flag (CTF)** writeups - a growing collection of challenges I've solved across web, crypto, pwn, forensics, reverse engineering, and OSINT domains.

Each writeup includes: - **Challenge Description**, **Exploit Walkthrough**, **Key Concepts / Lessons Learned**

## CTFs included

- [Huntress 2025](https://ctf.huntress.com/)
- More to come!

## GitHub Pages

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is my choice for note-taking. I've included both markdown files and an HTML export from the [Webpage HTML Export](https://github.com/KosmosisDire/obsidian-webpage-export) plugin.
